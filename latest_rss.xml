      <title>Launch HN: Hyprnote (YC S25) – An open-source AI meeting notetaker</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44725306</link>
      <description>Hi HN! We're Yujong, John, Duck, and Sung from Hyprnote (https://hyprnote.com). We're building an open-source, privacy-first AI note-taking app that runs fully on-device. Think of it as an open-source Granola. No Zoom bots, no cloud APIs, no data ever leaves your machine.Source code: https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote Demo video: https://hyprnote.com/demoWe built Hyprnote because some of our friends told us that their companies banned certain meeting notetakers due to data concerns, or they simply felt uncomfortable sending data to unknown servers. So they went back to manual note-taking - losing focus during meetings and wasting time afterward.We asked: could we build something just as useful, but completely local?Hyprnote is a desktop app that transcribes and summarizes meetings on-device. It captures both your mic input and system audio, so you don't need to invite bots. It generates a summary based on the notes you take. Everything runs on local AI models by default, using Whisper and HyprLLM. HyprLLM is our proof-of-concept model fine-tuned from Qwen3 1.7B. We learned that summarizing meetings is a very nuanced task and that a model's raw intelligence (or weight) doesn't matter THAT much. We'll release more details on evaluation and training once we finish the 2nd iteration of the model (still not that good we can make it a lot better).Whisper inference: https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/blob/main/crates/whispe...AEC inference: https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/blob/main/crates/aec/sr...LLM inference: https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/blob/main/crates/llama/...We also learned that for some folks, having full data controllability was as important as privacy. So we support custom endpoints, allowing users to bring in their company's internal LLM. For teams that need integrations, collaboration, or admin controls, we're working on an optional server component that can be self-hosted. Lastly, we're exploring ways to make Hyprnote work like VSCode, so you can install extensions and build your own workflows around your meetings.We believe privacy-first tools, powered by local models, are going to unlock the next wave of real-world AI apps.We're here and looking forward to your comments!

      <title>Show HN: I built an AI that turns any book into a text adventure game</title>
      <link>https://www.kathaaverse.com/</link>
      <description>It's a web app that uses AI to turn any book into a playable text adventure. Your favorite book, but your choices, hence your story. You can even "remix" the genre like playing Dune as a noir detective story.Note: Work in progress. Suggestions are welcome.

Philosopher Meghan Sullivan believes that traditions like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are filled with moral questions that invite discussion and reflection. She challenges the idea that philosophy must be strictly secular, pointing out how religious stories and parables often resemble the open-ended questioning found in ancient dialogues like Plato’s Republic. These connections support the idea that religious texts are not meant to shut down debate, but encourage it. For Sullivan, exploring faith through philosophical conversation helps us think more clearly about how to live and what it means to be human.

      <title>The beauty of ideals</title>
      <link>https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-beauty-of-ideals-b3dccf72</link>
      <description>Ideals are supposed to be unattainable for the great many. If everyone could be the smartest, strongest, prettiest, or best, there would be no need for ideals — we'd all just be perfect. But we're not, so ideals exist to show us the peak of humanity and to point our ambition and appreciation toward it.This is what I always hated about the 90s. It was a decade that made it cool to be a loser. It was the decade of MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head. It was the age of grunge. I'm generationally obliged to like Nirvana, but what a perfectly depressive, suicidal soundtrack to loser culture.Naomi Wolf's The Beauty Myth was published in 1990. It took a critical theory-like lens on beauty ideals, and finding it all so awfully oppressive. Because, actually, seeing beautiful, slim people in advertising or media is bad. Because we don't all look like that! And who's even to say what "beauty" is, anyway? It's all just socially constructed! The final stage of that dead-end argument appeared as an ad here in Copenhagen thirty years later during the 2020 insanity: I passed it every day biking the boys to school for weeks. Next to other slim, fit Danes also riding their bikes. None of whom resembled the grotesque display of obesity towering over them on their commute from Calvin Klein.While this campaign was laughably out of place in Copenhagen, it's possible that it brought recognition and representation in some parts of America. But a celebration of ideals it was not.That's the problem with the whole "representation" narrative. It proposes we're all better off if all we see is a mirror of ourselves, however obese, lazy, ignorant, or incompetent, because at least it won't be "unrealistic". Screw that. The last thing we need is a patronizing message that however little you try, you're perfect just the way you are.No, the beauty of ideals is that they ask more of us. Ask us to pursue knowledge, fitness, and competence by taking inspiration from the best human specimens.Thankfully, no amount of post-modern deconstruction or academic theory babble seems capable of suppressing the intrinsic human yearning for excellence forever. The ideals are finally starting to emerge again.</description>

      <title>Building competency is better than therapy</title>
      <link>https://world.hey.com/dhh/building-competency-is-better-than-therapy-4622c6b7</link>
      <description>The world is waking to the fact that talk therapy is neither the only nor the best way to cure a garden-variety petite depression. Something many people will encounter at some point in their lives. Studies have shown that exercise, for example, is a more effective treatment than talk therapy (and pharmaceuticals!) when dealing with such episodes. But I'm just as interested in the role building competence can have in warding off the demons.And partly because of this meme: I've talked about it before, but I keep coming back to the fact that it's exactly backwards. That signing up for an educational quest into Linux, history, or motorcycle repair actually is an incredibly effective alternative to therapy! At least for men who'd prefer to feel useful over being listened to, which, in my experience, is most of them.This is why I find it so misguided when people who undertake those quests sell their journey short with self-effacing jibes about how much an unattractive nerd it makes them to care about their hobby. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi detailed back in 1990 how peak human happiness arrives exactly in these moments of flow when your competence is stretched by a difficult-but-doable challenge. Don't tell me those endorphins don't also help counter the darkness.But it's just as much about the fact that these pursuits of competence usually offer a great opportunity for community as well that seals the deal. I've found time and again that people are starved for the kind of topic-based connections that, say, learning about Linux offers in spades. You're not just learning, you're learning with others.That is a time-tested antidote to depression: Forming and cultivating meaningful human connections. Yes, doing so over the internet isn't as powerful as doing it in person, but it's still powerful. It still offers community, involvement, and plenty of invitation to carry a meaningful burden.Open source nails this trifecta of motivations to a T. There are endless paths of discovery and mastery available. There are tons of fellow travelers with whom to connect and collaborate. And you'll find an unlimited number of meaningful burdens in maintainerships open for the taking.So next time you see that meme, you should cheer that the talk therapy table is empty. Leave it available for the severe, pathological cases that exercise and the pursuit of competence can't cure. Most people just don't need therapy, they need purpose, they need competence, they need exercise, and they need community.</description>

      <description>People seem to be continuously disappointed by the fact that public companies are run by professional managers who don't operate from deep principles. But they shouldn't be. It's in everyone's interest that corporations set their sails to the wind and whims of the prevailing culture. It's the essence of capitalism: Give people what they want (especially when they change their minds)! Now, as an owner-operator, I can afford to have unpopular principles from time to time. I can afford to earn less than the theoretical maximum from the market as a consequence of these principles. That's because I'm playing with my own money. That's the privilege of being privately held.But even the most powerful professional CEO is on a short leash from the company's real owners, the shareholders. This is often maligned as the root of all evil in modern capitalism. That we've divorced the owner and the operator. And I think there's a worthy critique of that arrangement to be had, like Burnham in The Managerial Society. But I also think not enough appreciation is afforded this arrangement.Shareholders, in their Platonic ideal, only care about maximizing profits. That can occasionally be an incentive for amoral behavior, but more often, it's simply a driver towards making stuff that people want. Not what they say they want, but what they actually buy. That's why libertarians love to talk about the free-market economy as an information system. Supply-side economics notwithstanding, demand directs production and judges the contestants. If you don't make something people want, they won't buy it, and you'll soon be out of business.I thought about this today because of two popular marketing campaigns currently running in America. The one by Nike celebrating family, the other by American Eagle celebrating "good jeans". Here's a comparison someone made online using these companies' campaigns from the early 2020s and now: Quite the contrast! Almost looks like hypocrisy, doesn't it? How can you celebrate obesity one moment, then hour-glass ideals the next? How can you embrace undirected individualism before, then exalt family values at the height of excellence now?Easy: The vibe changed. Demand changed. Selling 2020 woke platitudes into a 2025 market is a clear way to lose your job as a professional manager. Because it's no longer what people want.Hell, it's most likely not even the same managers making these diametrically-opposed value judgments. Perhaps not even managers at all, but marketing agencies in tune with said prevailing culture. The big information system of commerce is sending a billion packets of intent all day long and the current message is now crystal clear: Blond babies and boobs are back in business!This was the original killer insight by the architects of the short-lived woke theocracy: If you can capture culture, you can capture capitalism. But it's one thing to capture culture, it's quite another to hold it.So now much of mainstream American culture has simply reverted to the roots of capitalism: Making things that most people want. By course-correcting the culture, we've course-corrected commerce. No corporate principles required.</description>

      <description>"The sense that we are a solid entity, an unchanging entity that exists someplace in our body and takes ownership of our body, and even ownership of our brain rather than being identical to our brain, that is where the illusion lies."

Author Annaka Harris argues that the brain’s constant dialogue with the world creates a shifting process, not a fixed identity, and how this discovery changes how we see our choices, our memories, and our place in nature. Harris also explores why quieting the brain’s default mode through meditation, altered states, or deep focus can dissolve the boundary between self and world. 0:00 The illusion of self 4:22 The brain as a dynamic process 6:53 Decision-making &amp; “free will" 10:33 Neuroscience of the self 13:11 Losing the self Read the video transcript ► https://bigthink.com/series/the-big-think-interview/annaka-harris-self/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=youtube_description ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Go Deeper with Big Think: ►Become a Big Think Member Get exclusive access to full interviews, early access to new releases, Big Think merch and more. https://members.bigthink.com/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=youtube_description ►Get Big Think+ for Business Guide, inspire and accelerate leaders at all levels of your company with the biggest minds in business. https://bigthink.com/plus/great-leaders-think-big/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=youtube_description ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- About Annaka Harris: Annaka Harris is the New York Times bestselling author of CONSCIOUS: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind and writer and producer of the forthcoming audio documentary series, LIGHTS ON.
