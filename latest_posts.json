      "title": "Launch HN: Lucidic (YC W25) – Debug, test, and evaluate AI agents in production",
      "content_text": "Hi HN, we’re Abhinav, Andy, and Jeremy, and we’re building Lucidic AI (https://dashboard.lucidic.ai), an AI agent interpretability tool to help observe/debug AI agents.Here is a demo: https://youtu.be/Zvoh1QUMhXQ.Getting started is easy with just one line of code. You just call lai.init() in your agent code and log into the dashboard. You can see traces of each run, cumulative trends across sessions, built-in or custom evals, and grouped failure modes. Call lai.create_step() with any metadata you want, memory snapshots, tool outputs, stateful info, and we'll index it for debugging.We did NLP research at Stanford AI Lab (SAIL), where we worked on creating an AI agent (w/ fine-tuned models and DSPy) to solve math olympiad problems (focusing on AIME/USAMO); and we realized debugging these agents was hard. But the last straw was when we built an e-commerce agent that could buy items online. It kept failing at checkout, and every one-line change, tweaking a prompt, switching to Llama, adjusting tool logic, meant another 10-minute rerun just to see if we hit the same checkout page.At this point, we were all like, this sucks, so we improved agent interpretability with better debugging, monitoring, and evals.We started by listening to users who told us traditional LLM observability platforms don't capture the complexity of agents. Agents have tools, memories, events, not just input/output pairs. So we automatically transform OTel (and/or regular) agent logs into interactive graph visualizations that cluster similar states based on memory and action patterns. We heard that people wanted to test small changes even with the graphs, so we created “time traveling,” where you can modify any state (memory contents, tool outputs, context), then re-simulate 30–40 times to see outcome distributions. We embed the responses, cluster by similarity, and show which modifications lead to stable vs. divergent behaviors.Then we saw people running their agent 10 times on the same task, watching each run individually, and wasting hours looking at mostly repeated states. So we built trajectory clustering on similar state embeddings (like similar tools or memories) to surface behavioral patterns across mass simulations.We then use that to create a force-directed layout that automatically groups similar paths your agent took, which displays states as nodes, actions as edges, and failure probability as color intensity. The clusters make failure patterns obvious; you see trends across hundreds of runs, not individual traces.Finally, when people saw our observability features, they naturally wanted evaluation capabilities. So we developed a concept for people to make their own evals called \"rubrics,\" which lets you define specific criteria, assign weights to each criterion, and set score definitions, giving you a structured way to measure agent performance against your exact requirements.To evaluate these criteria, we used our own platform to build an investigator agent that reviews your criteria and evaluates performance much more effectively than traditional LLM-as-a-judge approaches.To get started visit dashboard.lucidic.ai and https://docs.lucidic.ai/getting-started/quickstart. You can use it for free for 1,000 event and step creations.Look forward to your thoughts!

      "title": "Show HN: A high-altitude low-power flight computer for high-altitude balloons",
      "content_text": "I've been working on this for a while now, and I'm happy to share!I've been into launching weather balloons for a few years. One aspect of the hobby that really drew me in was the tracking side of things. Tracking systems let you follow the balloon's position throughout the flight and, most importantly, know exactly where it lands so you can recover the instrumentation. APRS is what I started out using during my first few years in the hobby, after I got my amateur radio license in 2020 (W0MXX). I designed a few small boards using the trackuino (https://github.com/trackuino/trackuino) firmware (while breaking 3 $70 radio modules along the way).I then got into recovering radiosondes, which are launched twice per day by the NWS and can be reprogrammed using RS41ng (https://github.com/mikaelnousiainen/RS41ng) to run many amateur radio tracking protocols. I was a bit dissatisfied with how large and heavy the radiosonde trackers were, so I designed my own tracking system, called Tiny4FSK.Tiny4FSK is a flight computer with built-in tracking using the Horus Binary v2 tracking system. This protocol was developed by the Project Horus team specifically for high-altitude balloons, and it brings features like high transmit rates, forward error correction, and excellent weak-signal performance in an open source package. It's designed to be as compact as possible and can run on a single AA battery for upwards of 17 hours.The main board comes with header rows that allow for out-of-the-box expansion. I developed a shield that supports the BME280 environmental sensor, the ICM-20948 9-axis IMU, and more via the Qwiic connector. It also features an OLED display for basic diagnostics.While I've pretty much polished the main tracking procedures (and have tested on multiple flights), I'm still developing the IMU code using a lightweight Kalman filter. Additionally, there isn't yet a wide network of Horus Binary decoding stations like the APRS network has (I-gates), but I hope that by promoting this protocol, more stations will pop up. This means that if you're not in an area with many receive stations, you'll need to set up your own using either Horus-GUI (https://github.com/projecthorus/horus-gui) or horusdemodlib (https://github.com/projecthorus/horusdemodlib).One issue I’m still working on is improving RF signal strength. Although the protocol is decodable in very low-noise environments, the transmit power appears to be lower than that of a typical radiosonde. This could be due to several factors: limited current on a weak power source (signal is stronger when powered from a bench supply), off-tuned filtering/matching, or not paying enough attention to the antenna. I'm planning to run more simulations to figure this out. That said, the signal is still decodable from the ground even at max altitude (~100,000 feet).On the more technical side, Tiny4FSK uses: - the SAMD21 microcontroller, which is an ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU - the TPS61200 boost converter, which is adjusted to output 3.3v - Si4063 radio module, which I use on the 70cm band - ATGM336H gps module - pretty cheap GPS module which works in airborne mode (>18km) - integrated BME280 temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor The code uses the Arduino framework to make it accessible to beginners.All flights using Horus Binary v2, including reprogrammed radiosondes, other custom trackers, and Tiny4FSK show up in real-time on Sondehub Amateur (https://amateur.sondehub.org). Flight data can be found in the /Media/Data folder on Github (there's several missing flights on there though).Thanks for reading, hope I didn’t mess anything up too badly in the post! -Max Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44734983 Points: 30 # Comments: 16",

      "content_text": "Hey HN,We are Winston, Edward, and James, and we built Meka Agent, an open-source framework that lets vision-based LLMs execute tasks directly on a computer, just like a person would.Backstory:In the last few months, we've been building computer-use agents that have been used by various teams for QA testing, but realized that the underlying browsing frameworks aren't quite good enough yet.As such, we've been working on a browsing agent.We achieved 72.7% on WebArena compared to the previous state of the art set by OpenAI's new ChatGPT agent at 65.4%. You can read more about it here: https://github.com/trymeka/webarena_evals.Today, we are open sourcing Meka, our state of the art agent, to allow anyone to build their own powerful, vision-based agents from scratch. We provide the groundwork for the hard parts, so you don't have to:* True vision-based control: Meka doesn't just read HTML. It looks at the screen, identifies interactive elements, and decides where to click, type, and scroll.* Full computer access: It's not sandboxed in a browser. Meka operates with OS-level controls, allowing it to handle system dialogues, file uploads, and other interactions that browser-only automation tools can't.* Extensible by design: We've made it easy to plug in your own LLMs and computer providers.* State-of-the-art performance: 72.7% on WebArenaOur goal is to enable developers to create repeatable, robust tasks on any computer just by prompting an agent, without worrying about the implementation details.We’d love to get your feedback on how this tool could fit into your automation workflows.

      "content_text": "We made this video in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators. Our memories aren’t perfect records of the past — they’re reconstructions shaped by brain activity. Neuroscientists Lisa Genova and André Fenton explain that a memory is created through neural patterns that can subtly shift each time we recall it. We may unknowingly add or lose details over time. Understanding this science helps us approach memory with more humility and empathy, and deepens our insight into how memories shape one’s identity and beliefs. About André Fenton: André Fenton, PhD, is a neuroscientist and professor at NYU’s Center for Neural Science. He co-discovered PKMzeta, a key molecule for long-term memory, and studies how the brain stores and retrieves information. His work explores cognition, mental illness, and memory disorders. Fenton also founded Bio‑Signal Group, which created an FDA-approved portable EEG. About Lisa Genova: Lisa Genova, PhD, is a neuroscientist and bestselling author with a Ph.D. from Harvard. Her debut novel, Still Alice, explored early-onset Alzheimer’s and became an Oscar-winning film. Through novels like Left Neglected and Inside the O’Briens, she blends neuroscience and storytelling to humanize brain disorders.",

Philosopher Meghan Sullivan believes that traditions like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are filled with moral questions that invite discussion and reflection. She challenges the idea that philosophy must be strictly secular, pointing out how religious stories and parables often resemble the open-ended questioning found in ancient dialogues like Plato’s Republic. These connections support the idea that religious texts are not meant to shut down debate, but encourage it. For Sullivan, exploring faith through philosophical conversation helps us think more clearly about how to live and what it means to be human. Read the video transcript ►https://bigthink.com/the-well/why-philosophy-needs-religion?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description_bigthink ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- About Meghan Sullivan: Meghan Sullivan is the Wilsey Family College Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, where she leads the Ethics Initiative and founded the Institute for Ethics and the Common Good. With support from the John Templeton Foundation, the Institute advances research and teaching on human flourishing. Sullivan’s work spans ethics, metaphysics, and religion. She’s the author of Time Biases and co-author of The Good Life Method, based on her acclaimed course “God and the Good Life.” ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- About The Well Do we inhabit a multiverse?

      "content_text": "Ideals are supposed to be unattainable for the great many. If everyone could be the smartest, strongest, prettiest, or best, there would be no need for ideals — we'd all just be perfect. But we're not, so ideals exist to show us the peak of humanity and to point our ambition and appreciation toward it.This is what I always hated about the 90s. It was a decade that made it cool to be a loser. It was the decade of MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head. It was the age of grunge. I'm generationally obliged to like Nirvana, but what a perfectly depressive, suicidal soundtrack to loser culture.Naomi Wolf's The Beauty Myth was published in 1990. It took a critical theory-like lens on beauty ideals, and finding it all so awfully oppressive. Because, actually, seeing beautiful, slim people in advertising or media is bad. Because we don't all look like that! And who's even to say what \"beauty\" is, anyway? It's all just socially constructed! The final stage of that dead-end argument appeared as an ad here in Copenhagen thirty years later during the 2020 insanity: I passed it every day biking the boys to school for weeks. Next to other slim, fit Danes also riding their bikes. None of whom resembled the grotesque display of obesity towering over them on their commute from Calvin Klein.While this campaign was laughably out of place in Copenhagen, it's possible that it brought recognition and representation in some parts of America. But a celebration of ideals it was not.That's the problem with the whole \"representation\" narrative. It proposes we're all better off if all we see is a mirror of ourselves, however obese, lazy, ignorant, or incompetent, because at least it won't be \"unrealistic\". Screw that. The last thing we need is a patronizing message that however little you try, you're perfect just the way you are.No, the beauty of ideals is that they ask more of us. Ask us to pursue knowledge, fitness, and competence by taking inspiration from the best human specimens.Thankfully, no amount of post-modern deconstruction or academic theory babble seems capable of suppressing the intrinsic human yearning for excellence forever. The ideals are finally starting to emerge again.",

      "title": "Building competency is better than therapy",
      "content_text": "The world is waking to the fact that talk therapy is neither the only nor the best way to cure a garden-variety petite depression. Something many people will encounter at some point in their lives. Studies have shown that exercise, for example, is a more effective treatment than talk therapy (and pharmaceuticals!) when dealing with such episodes. But I'm just as interested in the role building competence can have in warding off the demons.And partly because of this meme: I've talked about it before, but I keep coming back to the fact that it's exactly backwards. That signing up for an educational quest into Linux, history, or motorcycle repair actually is an incredibly effective alternative to therapy! At least for men who'd prefer to feel useful over being listened to, which, in my experience, is most of them.This is why I find it so misguided when people who undertake those quests sell their journey short with self-effacing jibes about how much an unattractive nerd it makes them to care about their hobby. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi detailed back in 1990 how peak human happiness arrives exactly in these moments of flow when your competence is stretched by a difficult-but-doable challenge. Don't tell me those endorphins don't also help counter the darkness.But it's just as much about the fact that these pursuits of competence usually offer a great opportunity for community as well that seals the deal. I've found time and again that people are starved for the kind of topic-based connections that, say, learning about Linux offers in spades. You're not just learning, you're learning with others.That is a time-tested antidote to depression: Forming and cultivating meaningful human connections. Yes, doing so over the internet isn't as powerful as doing it in person, but it's still powerful. It still offers community, involvement, and plenty of invitation to carry a meaningful burden.Open source nails this trifecta of motivations to a T. There are endless paths of discovery and mastery available. There are tons of fellow travelers with whom to connect and collaborate. And you'll find an unlimited number of meaningful burdens in maintainerships open for the taking.So next time you see that meme, you should cheer that the talk therapy table is empty. Leave it available for the severe, pathological cases that exercise and the pursuit of competence can't cure. Most people just don't need therapy, they need purpose, they need competence, they need exercise, and they need community.",

      "title": "You expect principles but should wish for none",
      "content_text": "People seem to be continuously disappointed by the fact that public companies are run by professional managers who don't operate from deep principles. But they shouldn't be. It's in everyone's interest that corporations set their sails to the wind and whims of the prevailing culture. It's the essence of capitalism: Give people what they want (especially when they change their minds)! Now, as an owner-operator, I can afford to have unpopular principles from time to time. I can afford to earn less than the theoretical maximum from the market as a consequence of these principles. That's because I'm playing with my own money. That's the privilege of being privately held.But even the most powerful professional CEO is on a short leash from the company's real owners, the shareholders. This is often maligned as the root of all evil in modern capitalism. That we've divorced the owner and the operator. And I think there's a worthy critique of that arrangement to be had, like Burnham in The Managerial Society. But I also think not enough appreciation is afforded this arrangement.Shareholders, in their Platonic ideal, only care about maximizing profits. That can occasionally be an incentive for amoral behavior, but more often, it's simply a driver towards making stuff that people want. Not what they say they want, but what they actually buy. That's why libertarians love to talk about the free-market economy as an information system. Supply-side economics notwithstanding, demand directs production and judges the contestants. If you don't make something people want, they won't buy it, and you'll soon be out of business.I thought about this today because of two popular marketing campaigns currently running in America. The one by Nike celebrating family, the other by American Eagle celebrating \"good jeans\". Here's a comparison someone made online using these companies' campaigns from the early 2020s and now: Quite the contrast! Almost looks like hypocrisy, doesn't it? How can you celebrate obesity one moment, then hour-glass ideals the next? How can you embrace undirected individualism before, then exalt family values at the height of excellence now?Easy: The vibe changed. Demand changed. Selling 2020 woke platitudes into a 2025 market is a clear way to lose your job as a professional manager. Because it's no longer what people want.Hell, it's most likely not even the same managers making these diametrically-opposed value judgments. Perhaps not even managers at all, but marketing agencies in tune with said prevailing culture. The big information system of commerce is sending a billion packets of intent all day long and the current message is now crystal clear: Blond babies and boobs are back in business!This was the original killer insight by the architects of the short-lived woke theocracy: If you can capture culture, you can capture capitalism. But it's one thing to capture culture, it's quite another to hold it.So now much of mainstream American culture has simply reverted to the roots of capitalism: Making things that most people want. By course-correcting the culture, we've course-corrected commerce. No corporate principles required.",
