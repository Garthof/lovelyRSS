      "title": "Show HN: TraceRoot – Open-source agentic debugging for distributed services",
      "content_text": "Hey Xinwei and Zecheng here, we are the authors of TraceRoot (https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot).TraceRoot (https://traceroot.ai) is an open-source debugging platform that helps engineers fix production issues faster by combining structured traces, logs, source code contexts and discussions in Github PRs, issues and Slack channels, etc. with AI Agents.At the heart are our lightweight Python (https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot-sdk) and TypeScript (https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot-sdk-ts) SDKs - they can hook into your app using OpenTelemetry and captures logs and traces. These are either sent to a local Jaeger (https://www.jaegertracing.io/) + SQLite backend or to our cloud backend, where we correlate them into a single view. From there, our custom agent takes over.The agent builds a heterogeneous execution tree that merges spans, logs, and GitHub context into one internal structure. This allows it to model the control and data flow of a request across services. It then uses LLMs to reason over this tree - pruning irrelevant branches, surfacing anomalous spans, and identifying likely root causes. You can ask questions like “what caused this timeout?” or “summarize the errors in these 3 spans”, and it can trace the failure back to a specific commit, summarize the chain of events, or even propose a fix via a draft PR.We also built a debugging UI that ties everything together - you explore traces visually, pick spans of interest, and get AI-assisted insights with full context: logs, timings, metadata, and surrounding code. Unlike most tools, TraceRoot stores long-term debugging history and builds structured context for each company - something we haven’t seen many others do in this space.What’s live today:- Python and TypeScript SDKs for structured logs and traces.- AI summaries, GitHub issue generation, and PR creation.- Debugging UI that ties everything togetherTraceRoot is MIT licensed and easy to self-host (via Docker). We support both local mode (Jaeger + SQLite) and cloud mode. Inspired by OSS projects like PostHog and Supabase - core is free, enterprise features like agent mode multi-tenant and slack integration are paid.If you find it interesting, you can see a demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb-D3LM0sJMWe’d love you to try TraceRoot (https://traceroot.ai) and share any feedback. If you're interested, our code is available here: https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot. If we don’t have something, let us know and we’d be happy to build it for you. We look forward to your comments! Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44759406 Points: 33 # Comments: 8",

      "content_text": "Hi HN, we’re Patrick and James! Artificial Societies (https://societies.io) lets you simulate your target audience so you can test marketing, messaging and content before you launch them.Here’s a quick product demo: https://www.loom.com/share/c0ce8ab860c044c586c13a24b6c9b391?...Marketers always say that half their spend will be wasted - they just don’t know which half. Real-world experiments help, but they’re too slow and expensive to run at scale. So, we’re building simulations that let you test rapidly and cheaply to find the best version of your message.How it works:- We create AI personas based on real-world data from actual individuals, collected from publicly available social media profiles and web sources.- For each audience, we retrieve relevant personas from our database and map them out on an interactive social network graph, which is designed to replicate patterns of social influence.- Once you’ve drafted your message, each experiment runs a multi-agent simulation where the personas react to your content and interact with each other - these take 30s to 2 minutes to run. Then, we then surface results and insights to help you improve your messaging.Our two biggest challenges are accuracy and UI. We’ve tested our performance at predicting how LinkedIn posts perform, and the initial results have been promising. Our model has an R2 of 0.78 and we’ve found that “message spread” in our simulations is the single most important predictor of actual engagements when looking at posts made by the same authors. But there’s a long way to go in generalising these simulations to other contexts, and finding ground truth data for evals. We have some more info on accuracy here: https://societies.io/#accuracyIn terms of UI, our biggest challenge is figuring out whether the ‘experiment’ form factor is attractive to users. We’ve deliberately focused on this (over AI surveys) as experiments leverage our expertise in social influence and how ideas spread between personas.James and I are both behavioral scientists by training but took different paths to get here. I helped businesses run A/B tests to boost sales and retention. Meanwhile, James became a data scientist and, in his spare time, hooked together 33,000 LLM chatbots and wrote a paper about it (https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10....). He showed me the simulations and we decided to make a startup out of it.Pricing: Artificial Societies is free to try. New users get 3 free credits and then a two week free trial. Pro accounts get unlimited simulations for $40/month. We’re planning on introducing teams later, and enterprise pricing for custom-built audiences.We’d love you to give the tool a try and share your thoughts!

      "content_text": "If your executive calendar is packed back to back, you have no room for fires, customers, or serendipities. You've traded all your availability for efficiency. That's a bad deal.Executives of old used to know this! That's what the long lunches, early escapes to the golf course, and reading the paper at work were all about. A great fictional example of this is Bert Cooper from Mad Men. He knew his value was largely in his network. He didn't have to grind every minute of every day to prove otherwise. His function was to leap into action when the critical occasion arose or decision needed to be made.But modern executives are so insecure about seeming busy 24/7 that they'll wreck their business trying to prove it. Trying to outwork everyone. Sacrificing themselves thin so they can run a squirrel-brain operation that's constantly chasing every nutty idea.Now someone is inevitably going to say \"but what about Elon!!\". He's actually a perfect illustration of doing this right, actually. Even if he works 100-hour weeks, he's the CEO of 3 companies, has a Diablo IV addiction, and keeps a busy tweeting schedule too. In all of that, I'd be surprised if there was more than 20-30h per company per week on average. And your boss is not Elon.Wide open calendars should not be seen as lazy, but as intentional availability. It's time we brought them back into vogue.",

      "content_text": "We made this video in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators. Our memories aren’t perfect records of the past — they’re reconstructions shaped by brain activity. Neuroscientists Lisa Genova and André Fenton explain that a memory is created through neural patterns that can subtly shift each time we recall it. We may unknowingly add or lose details over time. Understanding this science helps us approach memory with more humility and empathy, and deepens our insight into how memories shape one’s identity and beliefs. About André Fenton: André Fenton, PhD, is a neuroscientist and professor at NYU’s Center for Neural Science. He co-discovered PKMzeta, a key molecule for long-term memory, and studies how the brain stores and retrieves information. His work explores cognition, mental illness, and memory disorders. Fenton also founded Bio‑Signal Group, which created an FDA-approved portable EEG. About Lisa Genova: Lisa Genova, PhD, is a neuroscientist and bestselling author with a Ph.D. from Harvard. Her debut novel, Still Alice, explored early-onset Alzheimer’s and became an Oscar-winning film. Through novels like Left Neglected and Inside the O’Briens, she blends neuroscience and storytelling to humanize brain disorders.",

Philosopher Meghan Sullivan believes that traditions like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are filled with moral questions that invite discussion and reflection. She challenges the idea that philosophy must be strictly secular, pointing out how religious stories and parables often resemble the open-ended questioning found in ancient dialogues like Plato’s Republic. These connections support the idea that religious texts are not meant to shut down debate, but encourage it. For Sullivan, exploring faith through philosophical conversation helps us think more clearly about how to live and what it means to be human. Read the video transcript ►https://bigthink.com/the-well/why-philosophy-needs-religion?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description_bigthink ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- About Meghan Sullivan: Meghan Sullivan is the Wilsey Family College Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, where she leads the Ethics Initiative and founded the Institute for Ethics and the Common Good. With support from the John Templeton Foundation, the Institute advances research and teaching on human flourishing. Sullivan’s work spans ethics, metaphysics, and religion. She’s the author of Time Biases and co-author of The Good Life Method, based on her acclaimed course “God and the Good Life.” ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- About The Well Do we inhabit a multiverse?
