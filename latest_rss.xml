      <title>Show HN: Wordle-style game for Fermi questions</title>
      <link>https://www.fermiquestions.org/</link>
      <description>Some months ago @andrewrn tried to create a Wordle-style site for order-of-magnitude thinking. This was a wonderful idea, but the actual site was somewhat over-engineered and confusing. (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43632278)In the past week, I looked at this idea again and built a very simple site which gives you a new Fermi estimation question every day:How many new cars were sold in the US in 2024?; How many humans have ever lived (including those currently alive)?; How many chickens are slaughtered for meat every year?To win, you need a guess within ±10% of the correct answer. For this you have a maximum of 6 tries and after each guess, you can see if your answer was too high or too low.Fermi questions are, by the way, a wonderful way to build up your own numeracy and sense for order-of-magnitude differences. Douglas Hofstadter proposed using them for exactly this reason in his essay "Number Numbness, or Why Innumeracy May Be Just as Dangerous as Illiteracy" (https://gwern.net/doc/math/1982-hofstadter-2.pdf) Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44769338 Points: 3 # Comments: 3</description>

      <description>One pulls everything in and never lets go. The other refuses to let anything in at all. They’re cosmic opposites: mysterious, extreme, and maybe even connected in strange ways we still don’t understand.

      <title>Executives should be the least busy people</title>
      <link>https://world.hey.com/dhh/executives-should-be-the-least-busy-people-bb94fb18</link>
      <description>If your executive calendar is packed back to back, you have no room for fires, customers, or serendipities. You've traded all your availability for efficiency. That's a bad deal.Executives of old used to know this! That's what the long lunches, early escapes to the golf course, and reading the paper at work were all about. A great fictional example of this is Bert Cooper from Mad Men. He knew his value was largely in his network. He didn't have to grind every minute of every day to prove otherwise. His function was to leap into action when the critical occasion arose or decision needed to be made.But modern executives are so insecure about seeming busy 24/7 that they'll wreck their business trying to prove it. Trying to outwork everyone. Sacrificing themselves thin so they can run a squirrel-brain operation that's constantly chasing every nutty idea.Now someone is inevitably going to say "but what about Elon!!". He's actually a perfect illustration of doing this right, actually. Even if he works 100-hour weeks, he's the CEO of 3 companies, has a Diablo IV addiction, and keeps a busy tweeting schedule too. In all of that, I'd be surprised if there was more than 20-30h per company per week on average. And your boss is not Elon.Wide open calendars should not be seen as lazy, but as intentional availability. It's time we brought them back into vogue.</description>

      <title>Why do we all remember the same things differently?</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1KnTEjxFM0E</link>
      <description>We made this video in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators. Our memories aren’t perfect records of the past — they’re reconstructions shaped by brain activity. Neuroscientists Lisa Genova and André Fenton explain that a memory is created through neural patterns that can subtly shift each time we recall it. We may unknowingly add or lose details over time. Understanding this science helps us approach memory with more humility and empathy, and deepens our insight into how memories shape one’s identity and beliefs. About André Fenton: André Fenton, PhD, is a neuroscientist and professor at NYU’s Center for Neural Science. He co-discovered PKMzeta, a key molecule for long-term memory, and studies how the brain stores and retrieves information. His work explores cognition, mental illness, and memory disorders. Fenton also founded Bio‑Signal Group, which created an FDA-approved portable EEG. About Lisa Genova: Lisa Genova, PhD, is a neuroscientist and bestselling author with a Ph.D. from Harvard. Her debut novel, Still Alice, explored early-onset Alzheimer’s and became an Oscar-winning film. Through novels like Left Neglected and Inside the O’Briens, she blends neuroscience and storytelling to humanize brain disorders.</description>

Subscribe to The Well on YouTube ► https://bit.ly/thewell-youtube Watch The Well’s next interview with Betül Kaçar ► The ocean is evolving, and it’s not based on the ‘survival of the fittest’ https://youtu.be/nl_-nmZ4_Xc What if religious texts were some of our most significant sources of philosophical insight? Philosopher Meghan Sullivan believes that traditions like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are filled with moral questions that invite discussion and reflection. She challenges the idea that philosophy must be strictly secular, pointing out how religious stories and parables often resemble the open-ended questioning found in ancient dialogues like Plato’s Republic. These connections support the idea that religious texts are not meant to shut down debate, but encourage it. For Sullivan, exploring faith through philosophical conversation helps us think more clearly about how to live and what it means to be human.
